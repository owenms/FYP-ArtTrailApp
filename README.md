Final year project: Art Trail App for mobile Android devices, specifically Android KitKat devices.

This project uses various tools, such as Geofence, Location, and Maps API to direct users to and give information
about where the art is. 
It also keeps track of all users who went to each art piece to present data to the shop keepers to see if more people
went into their store.
